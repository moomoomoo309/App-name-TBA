# App-name-TBA
App-name-TBA allows students (and potentially staff) to have a unified calendar (Google Calendar, Remind101, Outlook integration, anyone?) which contains all of their events on a given day. Events are provided by event lists the user can subscribe to, which are located in event repositories, which can be added by the user, or from other calendars, or even Remind101.

The second (and more difficult) part of this app is Navigation: It will allow one to navigate from any room in Piscataway High School to any other, hopefully accounting for the average traffic (which will be input manually by us, because we can't do live traffic without a massive userbase).
