# App-name-TBA
App-name-TBA allows students (and potentially staff) to have a unified calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook integration, anyone?) which contains all of their events on a given day. Events are provided by event lists the user can subscribe to, which are located in event repositories, which can be added by the user, or from other calendars.

The second (and more difficult) part of this app is Navigation: A scrollable map showing where the individual is (assuming GPS is enabled)
