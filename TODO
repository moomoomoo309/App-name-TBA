DONE 1) Write the 1, 3, and 7 day Calendar views (Using a BoxLayout inside of a ScollView for the events, and the material design colors from DatePicker)

DONE 2) Write the schedule view (A BoxLayout or GridLayout separated by date with the dates on the left side, and a BorderImage between elements, with the actual events located on the right)

DONE 3) Write the settings menu (Kivy has built-in stuff for this! Look for it!)

Android only. 4) Figure out how to package the app for Android AND iOS (Buildozer is a bit finnicky, unfortunately.)

DONE 5) Unify the UI (Use the same colors across the whole app, from the options, using colors from the Material Design docs http://www.materialpalette.com/ https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html )

6) After 1-4 are done (5 optional), get feedback from Sara, because she's awesome.

After 1-6 are done:

NOPE 7) Do some beginning work on the map

DONE? 8) Polish everything (Finish 5 and 5.5 if it's not done!)

SOON 9) Begin Google Calendar Integration

NOPE 10) (Optional) Try to make some disgustingly hacky Remind101 Integration

After 7-9 are done:

NOPE 11) Present the polished app to Mr. Soin, then the administrators once he's approved it.

NOPE 12) Get feedback from the less technically-savvy people who would actually be using the app.
